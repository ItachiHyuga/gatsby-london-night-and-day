### What is different from London After Midnight?
* Removed Google Fonts, using system fonts in stead (for speed and privacy :)
* Using the London After Midnight is now “Dark mode” (the default), and the original London as “Light mode”. Both work in progress
* Use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) in stead of plain CSS. Work in progress
